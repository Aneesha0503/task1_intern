It has been cleaned using Excel and follows consistent formatting for further analysis or visualization.
Cleaning Steps Applied:
Removed duplicate rows
Standardized column headers (e.g., order_number, product_line)
Corrected inconsistent text values (status, productline, country, dealsize)
Converted all date values to a consistent format (dd-mm-yyyy)
Trimmed extra spaces and applied proper casing
Cleaned phone numbers and postal codes
Handled missing values appropriately
